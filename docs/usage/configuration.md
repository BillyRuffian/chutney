# Configuration

Chutney looks for a configuration file in the current directory called `config/chutney.yml`. This configuration mostly switches on individual linters globally, but a few have addition parameters which can be configured (e.g. the maximum characters in a step).

A default configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/BillyRuffian/chutney/blob/master/config/default.yml).
