# Best practice for Cucumber
{: .fs-9 }


Chutney tastes your Cumber feature files and lets you know if they're tasty or nasty.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

You're trying to follow TDD or ATDD principles, you're writing executable specifications in gherkin using Cucumber, you're trying to do *the right thing* but are you doing *the thing right*?

Cucumber itself is an awesome tool which bridges with gap between business language, software development language and the language of testers. With all these folks interested, it's easy to write problematic and hard to maintain features. Chutney tries to help with that by having a common set of quality rules for your feature files.

Chutney is able to lint feature files in any spoken language supported by Cucumber.
