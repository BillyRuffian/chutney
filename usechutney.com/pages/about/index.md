Chutney is originally a fork of the abandoned [gherkin_lint](https://github.com/funkwerk/gherkin_lint). The original authors remain credited in the gemspec. It has been reworked and extended to support more rules and to be more flexible.

It is much beloved by me. Although it's a personal project, it's used extensively by my employer and influenced by the needs of my colleagues. I hope it will be useful to you as well. I am very open to ideas, feedback and contributions.

Chutney is licenced under the [MIT licence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BillyRuffian/chutney/refs/heads/master/LICENSE.txt). Do with it what you will and have fun.

A huge hat tip to Eric Kessler for his work on [cuke_modeler](https://github.com/enkessler/cuke_modeler) which is used to parse the Gherkin files (he also publishes the gherkin linter [cuke_linter](https://github.com/enkessler/cuke_linter) if chutney does not fit your needs).

### What's the Billy Ruffian thing?

HMS Bellerophon was a 74-gun third-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy. Launched in 1786, she served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, mostly on blockades or convoy escort duties. She fought in three fleet actions: the Glorious First of June, the Battle of the Nile and the Battle of Trafalgar. She became famous as the ship upon which Napoleon surrendered and which transported him into exile in 1815.

Her sailors, not being educated in the Classics, struggled to pronounce her name and so she became known as the Billy Ruffian and her crew as the "Billy Ruffians". The name stuck and was used as a nickname for the ship for the rest of her career.

Since no one in coffee shops can spell my name, I adopted 'Billy' which turned into 'Billy Ruffian'. It's also a bloody good story.
