Chutney is originally a fork of the abandoned [gherkin_lint](https://github.com/funkwerk/gherkin_lint). The original authors remain credited in the gemspec. It has been reworked and extended to support more rules and to be more flexible.

It is much beloved by me. Although it's a personal project, it's used extensively by my employer and influenced by the needs of my colleagues. I hope it will be useful to you as well. I am very open to ideas, feedback and contributions.

Chutney is licenced under the [MIT licence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BillyRuffian/chutney/refs/heads/master/LICENSE.txt). Do with it what you will and have fun.

A huge hat tip to Eric Kessler for his work on [cuke_modeler](https://github.com/enkessler/cuke_modeler) which is used to parse the Gherkin files (he also publishes the gherkin linter [cuke_linter](https://github.com/enkessler/cuke_linter) if chutney does not fit your needs).
