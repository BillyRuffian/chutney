You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.   Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:   YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP   Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and MARKUP is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.   Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:   def print_hi(name)   puts \"Hi, #{name}\" end print_hi('Tom') #=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.  Check out the Jekyll docs for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at Jekyll’s GitHub repo. If you have questions, you can ask them on Jekyll Talk.

For example @disableTooLongStep.   If used at the feature level, the linter will be deactivated for the whole file, used at the scenario level, only that one scenario will be excused.

    "title": "About",
    "excerpt":"Chutney is originally a fork of the abandoned gherkin_lint. The original authors remain credited in the gemspec. It has been reworked and extended to support more rules and to be more flexible.   It is much beloved by me. Although it’s a personal project, it’s used extensively by my employer and influenced by the needs of my colleagues. I hope it will be useful to you as well. I am very open to ideas, feedback and contributions.   Chutney is licenced under the MIT licence. Do with it what you will and have fun.   A huge hat tip to Eric Kessler for his work on cuke_modeler which is used to parse the Gherkin files (he also publishes the gherkin linter cuke_linter if chutney does not fit your needs).   What’s the Billy Ruffian thing?   HMS Bellerophon was a 74-gun third-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy. Launched in 1786, she served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, mostly on blockades or convoy escort duties. She fought in three fleet actions: the Glorious First of June, the Battle of the Nile and the Battle of Trafalgar. She became famous as the ship upon which Napoleon surrendered and which transported him into exile in 1815.   Her sailors, not being educated in the Classics, struggled to pronounce her name and so she became known as the Billy Ruffian and her crew as the “Billy Ruffians”. The name stuck and was used as a nickname for the ship for the rest of her career.   Since no one in coffee shops can spell my name, I adopted ‘Billy’ which turned into ‘Billy Ruffian’. It’s also a bloody good story.  ","url": "http://localhost:4000/pages/about/"
