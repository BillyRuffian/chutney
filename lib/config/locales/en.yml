    avoid_full_stop: >- # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop
      Avoid using a full-stop in steps so that it is easier to re-use them.
    avoid_outline_for_single_example: >-
      Avoid using Scenario Outlines when you only have a single example.
      Use a Scenario instead.
    avoid_scripting: >-
      You have %{count} When steps when you should only have one.
      Be careful not to add And steps following a When.
    background_does_more_than_setup: >-
      The Background does more than setup. It should only contain Given steps.
    background_requires_multiple_scenarios: >-
      Avoid using Background if you only have a single scenario.
    bad_scenario_name: >-
      You should avoid using words like '%{word}' in your scenario names.
    file_name_differs_feature_name: >-
      The name of the feature should reflect the file name. Consider renaming this feature
      to '%{expected}'.
    givens_after_background: >-
      Avoid using the 'Given' keyword in scenarios if you have a background.
      Instead, setup steps begin your scenario and should start with an 'And' or 'But' keyword.
    invalid_file_name: >-
      Filenames of feature files should be in snake case.
      You should name this file '%{recommended_name}'.
    invalid_step_flow:
      action_last: >-
        This scenario has the action as the last step of the scenario. A 'Then' assertion
        step should always follow a 'When' action step.
      given_order: >-
        You have a 'Given' setup step after a 'When' action step or a 'Then' assertion step.
        Setup steps should always be the first steps of a scenario.
      missing_action: >-
        This scenario is missing an action step -- it does not have a 'When'.
    missing_example_name: >-
      You have a scenerio with more than one example table, at least one of which is
      unnamed or has a duplicate name.
      You should give your example tables clear and meaningful names when you have more than one.
    missing_feature_description: >-
      Features should have a description / value statement so that the importance of the feature
      is well understood.
    missing_feature_name: >-
      This feature is unnamed. You should name all features.
    missing_scenario_name: >-
      This scenario is unnamed. You should name all scenarios.
    missing_test_action: >-
      Your test has no action step. All scenarios should have a 'When' step indicating the
      action being taken.
    missing_test_verification: >-
      Your test has no verification step. All scenarios should have a 'Then' step indicating
      the assertion being tested.
    required_tags_starts_with: >-
      You have tags which do not match the required format. Allowed prefixes are '%{allowed}'.
    scenario_names_match: >-
      You have a scenario name which does not match the required format.
      Allowed patterns are '%{pattern}'.
    same_tag_for_all_scenarios:
      feature_level: >-
        You are using the same tag (%{tag}) for all scenarios.
        Use this tag at the feature level instead.
      example_level: >-
        You are using the same tag (%{tag}) for all examples in this scenario.
        Use this tag at the scenario level instead.
    tag_used_multiple_times: >-
      Avoid repeating tags at the feature and scenario level. These tags were used
      in both: %{tags}.
    too_clumsy: >-
      This scenario is too clumsy at %{length} characters. Scenarios should be no more than
      400 characters long.
    too_long_step: >-
      This step is too long at %{length} characters. It should be no longer than %{max}
      characters.
    too_many_different_tags: >-
      There are too many tags in this feature. There are %{count} and the maximum is %{max}.
    too_many_steps: >-
      There are too many steps in this feature. There are %{count} and the maximum is %{max}.
    too_many_tags: >-
      There are too many tags in this feature. There are %{count} and the maximum is %{max}.
    unique_scenario_names: >-
      The scenario name '%{name}' is duplicated, first used at line %{line}, column %{column}.
    unknown_variable: >-
      The variable '%{variable}' is referenced in your test but its value is never set.
    unused_variable: >-
      The variable '%{variable}' is declared but never used.
    use_background: >-
      The step '%{step}' is used in all the scenarios of this feature. It should be moved
      to the background steps.
    use_outline: >-
      Scenarios are similar by %{pct}%, you should use scenario outlines to simplify.
      %{lhs_name} (%{lhs_line}) vs %{rhs_name} (%{rhs_line})
